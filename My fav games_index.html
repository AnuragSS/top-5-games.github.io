  I knew Doom Eternal had proven its point when I started taking down Marauders without breaking a sweat, really.
  <br>These terrifying, devil-horned axe-wielders had been life-threatening challenges when they were first introduced
  <br>midway through the game, but a while later I delighted in turning the tables on them thanks to some powerful and hard-earned upgrades
<br>Doom Eternal not only retains the wild, high-speed, to-the-brink-of-death-and-back-again ebb and flow of combat that its 2016 predecessor excelled at,
<br>it tweaks the formula to introduce more strategy, replayability, and ultimately, satisfaction to this 15+ hour first-person shooter campaign.

 <p>
  You see, Need for Speed 2015 brought with it a resurrection of the spirit of 2003 and 2004’s successful Underground games and saw the return of meaningful performance and visual customisation.<br>
  Between all the hokey live-action, first-person fist-bumping it also revolved around encounters with real-world automotive icons. That’s an idea I still genuinely like. <br>
  Of course, it was very short, the world was largely empty, there initially wasn’t any drag racing, and you couldn’t even pause the game in single-player. It was flawed, no doubt.<br>

<h1>3. Halo Master Chief Collection👍👍👍👍</h1>
<br>
<table cellspacing="30" border="7" bordercolor="Yellow">
  <tr>

  <p>
  The Halo series has the historic distinction of inspiring millions of gamers to spend hundreds of dollars on new consoles just to play it. The Master Chief Collection – which includes all four numbered entries in the series <br>
  – is a great reminder that Halo succeeded not because of hype or flavor-of-the-month popularity, but because of timeless first-person shooter design. With excellent stories, sandbox battlefields, great AI, and memorable multiplayer,<br>
   everything holds up against modern shooters, many of which owe a huge debt to Halo’s inspiration. It’s all presented beautifully, with remade graphics and sound that allow old hands like me to relive the glory days through rose-tinted glasses,<br>
    and new fans to appreciate the classics without having to look past decade-plus-old graphics. However, Halo’s memorable multiplayer modes are undermined by unacceptably unreliable and bug-ridden performance in the days after launch, to the point where<br>
    I can’t recommend that you buy Master Chief Collection right now for that functionality. That’s heartbreaking, but on the bright side there’s still more than enough single-player and co-op content here to strongly recommend it for those alone.

<p>
Ever since Far Cry 3, sneaking my way through outposts eliminating enemies one by one has been one of my favorite things to do in video games.<br>
 I’m happy to report that systematically taking down murderous thugs is just as fun in rural America as it is in the Himalayas, and that<br>
Far Cry 5 is another great game in the open-world series Ubisoft seems most willing to have fun with. It may be playing a familiar tune<br>
but all of these combat, physics, and wildlife systems all mix together to create unexpected moments of intense and hilarious action.

   <p>
  For me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane,<br>
  fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets.<br>
  Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path,<br>
   and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on<br>
   top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.
